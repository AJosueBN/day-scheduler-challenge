# week-five-day-scheduler-challenge Creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day
# The whole browser will feature updated HTML and CSS and will be powered by jQuery

# Things I have added or implemented to the task of modifying the day schedule calendar : 

- Added in JavaScript code and modified the calendar app to let it know whether we are in the past,present or future.This can be indicated through the colour codes within time blocks(Past - Grey , Present - Red , Future - Green)
- Added the current date inside the app to let the user know the current day,date and time as they are engaging within the app
- Added a for loop within the local storage to set/get items so that when I add an event/text on the time I like it will be saved in the application/local storage and will persist.
- Added/removed classes through if/else statements so the app can identify what time it's in when utilisied.
